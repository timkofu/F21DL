"Before you start completing the above tasks, create folders on your computer to store software you
produce, classifiers, Weka settings, screenshots and results of all your experiments. Archive these
folders and submit via Vision or via a repository link. As part of your coursework marking, you may be
asked to re-run all your experiments in the lab or show the trace of your work (remember, this
assignemnt is worth a quarter of your overall module mark!). So please store all of this data safely in a
way that will allow you to re-produce your results on request."
