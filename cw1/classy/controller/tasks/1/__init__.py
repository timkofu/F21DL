"""
[Data Conversion] Convert all csv files into arff format suitable for Weka. Some suitable data
set pre-processing may be needed before you can load the csv files to Weka.

Notes:
    * Convert the floats to integers
    * Is there discretazation(binning) or normalization(z-score et al) that's needed?
    * * The answer to that depends on groking how naive bayes works. Will do that.
    * * Also revise on how these are done with Python.
