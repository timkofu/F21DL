[Make conclusions] Make conclusions on the obtained improvements to clustering results. Make
sure you understand the various details of Weka’s output for different (hard and soft) clustering
algorithms when clustering is completed. Use Weka’s facilities to test the precision of clustering on this
data set. Using your work with Weka as a source, explain all pros and cons of using different clustering
algorithms on the given data set. Compare to the results of Bayesian classification on the same data set.
