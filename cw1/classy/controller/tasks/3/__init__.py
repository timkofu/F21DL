[Reducing the size, dealing with computational constraints] The given files may be too big for
standard settings of GUI Weka: decide how you are going to deal with this:
● You may reduce the number of attributes, as taught during the course. Record and explain all
choices made when you perform the reduction of attributes. A number of algorithms and options are
available in Weka. See Sections 2.1 -2.3 in
www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/Witten_et_al_2016_appendix.pdf
● Alternatively, you may use the full data set and the Weka command-line interface. See Section
5 of www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/Witten_et_al_2016_appendix.pdf) and manipulate the heap size
(see https://weka.wikispaces.com/OutOfMemoryException).
● Either choice is acceptable as long as you can perform the next task.
