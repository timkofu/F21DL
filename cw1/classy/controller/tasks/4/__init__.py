"""
[Classification: Performance of the Naive Bayes algorithm on the given data set] Run the Naive
Bayes tool in Weka on the resulting version of train_gr_smpl. To be able to do this, you may need to
apply several Weka “Filters”. Explain the reason for choosing and using these filters. Once you can run
the algorithm, record, compare and analyse the classifier’s accuracy on different classes (as given by the
Weka Summary and the confusion matrix).
