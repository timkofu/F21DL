"""
[Try to improve the classification, based on information from item 5] Using the information
about the top correlating features obtained in item (5), transform the full data set train_smpl so as to
keep the following attributes:
● Using only the top 2 non-class fields from each train_smpl_<label>.
● Using only the top 5 non-class fields from each train_smpl_<label>.
● Using only the top 10 non-class fields from each train_smpl_<label>.
You will have three data sets, with 14, 35 and 70 non-class attributes respectively. Repeat the
experiment described in item (4) on these three data sets.
