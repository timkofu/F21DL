[Make conclusions:] What kind of information about this data set did you learn, as a result of
the above experiments? You should ask questions such as: Which streets signs are harder to recognise?
Which street signs are most easily confused? Which attributes (fields) are more reliable and which are
less reliable in classification of street signs? What was the purpose of Tasks 5 and 6? What would happen
if the data sets you used in Tasks 4, 5 and 6 were not randomised? What would happen if there is crosscorrelation
between the non-class attributes? You will get more marks for more interesting and ``out of
the box‚Äù questions and answers. Explain your conclusions logically and formally, using the material
from the lecture notes and from your own reading to interpret the results that Weka produces.
