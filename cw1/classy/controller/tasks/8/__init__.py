"""
[Beyond Naïve Bayes: complex Bayesian Network Architectures] Build two or three Bayes
networks of more complex architecture for (a smaller version of) this data set, increasing the number
of connections among the nodes. Construct one of them semi-manually (e.g use K2 algorithm and vary
the maximum number of parents), and two others – using Weka’s algorithms for learning Bayes net
construction (e.g. use TAN or Hill Climbing algorithms). Run the experiments described in items 4-6
on these new Bayes network architectures. Record, compare and analyse the outputs, in the light of the
previous conclusions about the given data.
